# API Testing Guide for Greeting Event System

## Overview
This comprehensive guide documents all API testing performed on the greeting event system and the issues that were discovered and resolved. Use this as a reference when testing the APIs or encountering similar issues.

## Testing Summary ✅
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: All major APIs fully functional  
**Total Endpoints Tested**: 15+  
**Issues Found and Fixed**: 5  

## Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. Creator Profile Creation Error ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: "Creator profile already exists" error when testing the create creator profile endpoint.

**Root Cause**: The original `AuthController::register` method was auto-creating creator profiles during registration, but the `CreatorProfileController::store` method was designed to only create new profiles, causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Modified the `CreatorProfileController::store` method to handle both creation and updating of creator profiles, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

**Files Modified**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CreatorProfileController.php`

### 2. Database Query Error in Earnings Calculation ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: SQL error "Column 'price' not found" when accessing creator profile endpoints.

**Root Cause**: The `CreatorProfileService::calculateMonthlyEarnings` method was trying to sum a non-existent `price` column in the greetings table.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the earnings calculation method to use tier-based pricing instead of per-greeting pricing, implementing proper business logic with defined pricing tiers.

**Files Modified**: `app/Services/CreatorProfileService.php`

### 3. Template Validation Error ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Template creation/update failing due to validation on non-existent `price` field.

**Root Cause**: Template validation rules included a `price` field that doesn't exist in the database schema.

**Solution**: Removed the `price` field validation from `TemplateController` store and update methods.

**Files Modified**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TemplateController.php`

### 4. Missing User Profile Endpoint ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: No convenient endpoint to get current user's profile.

**Root Cause**: Only parameterized user endpoint existed (`/api/users/{id}`), requiring knowledge of user ID.

**Solution**: Added `profile()` method to `UserController` and route `GET /api/users/profile` for easy current user access.

**Files Modified**: 
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController.php`
- `routes/api.php`

### 5. Analytics Platform Stats Error ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: "Call to undefined method greetings()" error when accessing platform analytics.

**Root Cause**: The `User` model has `greetingsCreated()` and `greetingsReceived()` methods but analytics was calling non-existent `greetings()` method.

**Solution**: Fixed relationship method from `greetings` to `greetingsCreated` in `AnalyticsController::platformStats` method.

**Files Modified**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AnalyticsController.php`

- **Check**: Token expiration and refresh if needed
- **Verify**: User has proper permissions for endpoint

### 2. Validation Errors
- **Problem**: "The given data was invalid" errors
- **Solution**: Check request content-type is `application/json`
- **Check**: Ensure all required fields are provided
- **Verify**: Field formats match validation rules

### 3. Database Relationship Issues
- **Problem**: Missing related data in responses
- **Solution**: Check eager loading in controllers
- **Verify**: Foreign key constraints are properly set
- **Check**: Model relationship methods are correctly defined

### 4. Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Slow response times
- **Solution**: Use pagination for large datasets
- **Check**: For N+1 query problems
- **Verify**: Database indexes are in place

### 5. Creator Profile Issues
- **Problem**: "Creator profile already exists" (old issue)
- **Solution**: Use the updated hybrid endpoint that handles both creation and updates
- **Note**: This issue has been completely resolved

### 6. Analytics Calculation Errors
- **Problem**: Database column not found errors
- **Solution**: Ensure you're using the updated earnings calculation logic
- **Note**: Price-based calculations have been replaced with tier-based calculations

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create Profile for New Creator
1. Register a new user with `is_creator: true`
2. Login and get the bearer token
3. POST to `/api/creator-profiles` with profile data
4. Should return 201 status with new profile data

### Test 2: Update Profile for Existing Creator
1. Use an existing creator's token
2. POST to `/api/creator-profiles` with updated data
3. Should return 200 status with updated profile data

### Test 3: Get Current Profile
1. Use a creator's token
2. GET `/api/creator-profiles/my-profile`
3. Should return profile data with stats

### Test 4: Non-Creator Access
1. Use a celebrant's token (non-creator)
2. Try to POST to `/api/creator-profiles`
3. Should return 403 status with "Only creators can create creator profiles"

## Sample Test Data

### Creator Registration:
```json
{
    "name": "Test Creator",
    "email": "testcreator@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123",
    "is_creator": true,
    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01"
}
```

### Profile Creation/Update:
```json
{
    "bio": "Professional greeting creator with 5+ years experience",
    "specialties": ["birthday", "wedding", "anniversary"],
    "portfolio_url": "https://www.example.com/portfolio",
    "hourly_rate": 35.50,
    "availability_status": true
}
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

1. **No More "Profile Already Exists" Errors**: The store endpoint now handles both creation and updates seamlessly.

2. **Cleaner Registration Process**: User registration no longer auto-creates creator profiles, allowing users to set up their profiles when ready.

3. **Better User Experience**: Users can use the same endpoint to both create and update their profiles.

4. **New Profile Endpoint**: Users can easily check if they have a profile and get their current data with the `/my-profile` endpoint.

## Error Handling

- **403 Forbidden**: Non-creators trying to access creator endpoints
- **422 Validation Error**: Invalid data in request body
- **404 Not Found**: Profile doesn't exist (for my-profile endpoint)
- **500 Server Error**: Database or server issues
